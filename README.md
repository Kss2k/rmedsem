The goal of rmedsem is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmedsem from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ihrke/rmedsem")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rmedsem)

data <- haven::read_stata("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsbdemo.dta")
mod.txt <- "
read ~ math
science ~ read + math
"
summary(mod <- lavaan::sem(mod.txt, data=data))
#> Length  Class   Mode 
#>      1 lavaan     S4
out <- rmedsem(mod, indep="math", med="read", dep="science", 
               standardized=T, mcreps=5000,
               approach = c("bk","zlc"))
out
#> Significance testing of indirect effect (standardized)
#>         Estimates         Sobel         Delta    Monte.Carlo
#> 1 Indirect effect        0.2506        0.2506         0.2506
#> 2       Std. Err.        0.0456        0.0456         0.0458
#> 3         z-value        5.5006        5.4935         5.4612
#> 4         p-value      3.79e-08      3.94e-08       4.73e-08

#> Baron and Kenny approach to testing mediation
#>   STEP 1 - 'math:read' (X -> M) with B=0.662 and p=0.000
#>   STEP 2 - 'read:science' (M -> Y) with B=0.378 and p=0.000
#>   STEP 3 - 'math:science' (X -> Y) with B=0.380 and p=0.000
#>            As STEP 1, STEP 2 and STEP 3 as well as the Sobel's test above
#>            are significant the mediation is partial!
#> Zhao, Lynch & Chen's approach to testing mediation
#>   STEP 1 - 'math:science' (X -> Y) with B=0.380 and p=0.000
#>            As the Monte Carlo test above is significant, STEP 1 is
#>            significant and their coefficients point in same direction,
#>            you have complementary mediation (partial mediation)!
#>   RIT  =   (Indirect effect / Total effect)
#>            (0.251/0.631) = 0.397
#>            Meaning that about  40% of the effect of 'math'
#>            on 'science' is mediated by 'read'!
#>   RID  =   (Indirect effect / Direct effect)
#>            (0.251/0.380) = 0.659
#>            That is, the mediated effect is about 0.7 times as
#>            large as the direct effect of 'math' on 'science'!
