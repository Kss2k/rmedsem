The goal of rmedsem is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmedsem from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ihrke/rmedsem")
```

## Example

``` r
library(rmedsem)

data <- haven::read_stata("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsbdemo.dta")
mod.txt <- "
read ~ math
science ~ read + math
"
mod <- lavaan::sem(mod.txt, data=data)
out <- rmedsem(mod, indep="math", med="read", dep="science", 
               standardized=T, mcreps=5000,
               approach = c("bk","zlc"))
print(out)

#> Baron and Kenny approach to testing mediation
#>    STEP 1 - 'math:read' (X -> M) with B=0.662 and p=0.000
#>    STEP 2 - 'read:science' (M -> Y) with B=0.378 and p=0.000
#>    STEP 3 - 'math:science' (X -> Y) with B=0.380 and p=0.000
#>             As STEP 1, STEP 2 and STEP 3 as well as the Sobel's test above
#>             are significant the mediation is partial.
#> 
#> Zhao, Lynch & Chen's approach to testing mediation
#>   STEP 1 - 'math:science' (X -> Y) with B=0.380 and p=0.000
#>             As the Monte Carlo test above is significant, STEP 1 is
#>             significant and their coefficients point in same direction,
#>             there is complementary mediation (partial mediation).
#> 
#> Effect sizes
#>    RIT = (Indirect effect / Total effect)
#>          (0.251/0.631) = 0.397
#>          Meaning that about  40% of the effect of 'math'
#>          on 'science' is mediated by 'read'
#>    RID = (Indirect effect / Direct effect)
#>          (0.251/0.380) = 0.659
#>          That is, the mediated effect is about 0.7 times as
#>          large as the direct effect of 'math' on 'science'
