# Todo for future versions

- incorporate categorical variables for both mediator and dependent variables
- run simulations to show adequate recovery for the different methods
- multiple mediation?
- include more sophisticated effect-sizes?

- compare to: http://afhayes.com/introduction-to-mediation-moderation-and-conditional-process-analysis.html

- Bayesian estimation is missing effect-sizes
- 


- should we consider, at some point, to support "manual" SEMs? For example, when we
  extract coefficients and standard errors from a paper? We could still do the
  Monte-Carlo.
  - or we could simulate from the manually specified model and do a fully mediation analysis,
